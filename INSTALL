PsistatsRD v0.0.1 Installation
==============================

Python dependencies:
--------------------
Check the file requirements.txt for a list of python
dependencies.

Pygame has several library dependencies. For more information
on installing pygame visit:

http://www.pygame.org/install.html

It will probably be easier to use your OS's package manager to
install pygame, then create a virtualenv with that included.

Installation with pip:
----------------------
pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation:
1. Install necessary python dependencies
2. Configure PsistatsRD
3. Run PsistatsRD

Simple ;)
